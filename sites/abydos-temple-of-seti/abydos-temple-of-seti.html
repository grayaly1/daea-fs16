         <h3>Intro</h3>
		 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
		 <p>The Temple of Seti I of Abydos costruction began during the reign of Seti I (1318-1304 BC) and was later finished under the reign of his son, Rameses II (1304-1237 BC). The temple is known as the Great Temple of Abydos, this was built as a worship site for not only Pharaoh, but also the principal state deities, including Osiris. The temple included seven chapels, a pylon, two hypostyle halls, and two open courts. The temple is made of limestone in some areas and in others, constructed in sandstone. </p>

		 <h3>Geography </h3>
		 <hr></hr>
		 <p> Abydos is located within the low desert west of the Nile River near the city of Al-BayanƒÅ. This area was a sacred place for the Egyptian god, Osiris. Abydos is also located 150 kilometers North of Luxor, the floodplain within the area is very broad, and expands 14 kilometers from the west bank of the Nile to the high cliffs. Abydos is located about 11 kilometers from the bank of the Nile. The monuments here are placed in accordance with the flow of the Nile and not in the cardinal directional points. The Temple of Seti I is located in the Northern part of the site known as Arabah. (North Abydos) </p>

<h3>Abydos Kings List</h3>
<hr></hr>
<p>The Abydos King's list is one of the more prominent findings from the Temple of Seti I. This list gives archaeologists a better understanding of who had ruled from the first dynasty to the nineteenth dynasty. Like many other Pharaoh in the past, this king's list has some names omitted for what Seti I deemed illegitimate rulers. This list consists of 76 Kings and Pharaohs, within 3 rows with 38 cartouches in each row. () Of those omitted from the list are Hatshepsut and Akhenaten. This list is an important key in understanding the Kings and Pharaohs from the first couple dynasties, this list also is one of the most complete king's lists that have been found. () </p>

<h3>Abydos Excavations</h3>
<hr></hr>
<p>The city of Abydos was excavated by Flinders Petrie in the years of 1901-03 and is in a site that is approximately 76,800 square meters. However, much of the archaeological and textual data was fragmentary and difficult to interpret at parts. It is noted that the entire area of Abydos is sacred for the god Osiris and many of the other building and temples are dedicated to him in one form or another. (North Abydos) As mentioned in Flinders Petrie's book, the main part of the temple is had been built bu Seti I himself but "the completion of the front courts, and of the sculpturing, and the dedication of the temple, fell into the young king's reign [Rameses II]."(A History of Egypt vol. 3, p.41) Petrie also stated that Rameses felt that the temple was unfinished and the columns were not on their bases and statues were laying on the earth, it was also asserted that Rameses II ordered that the pylons and walls should be finished, as the hypostyle halls were already completed. Petrie believed that Rameses II took prided in finishing Seti I's temple, but the walls were filled with scenes of Rameses II and it was overshadowed. (p.41) </p>
